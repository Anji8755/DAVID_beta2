In this reading section, take a look at the three kinds of influence that 
an implementation project can have on your organization: major busi-
ness process modifications, new skills in the project team, and SAP as 
a company asset. This chapter will outline the positive impact that a 
successful project can achieve as you begin to dedicate resources to it.

29We’ll first focus on the business impact of an SAP implementation. Almost all implementing companies put an SAP system in place to enhance their business processes. However, we will see that the project affects far more than company business processes. It will strengthen the skills of the project team and make SAP a long-term company asset.2How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusinessEveryone knows that an SAP implementation project changes a company. Lesswell known are the ways those changes take place and their long-term impacts onthe implementing company. Through the process of deploying the SAP system,these changes will take place—sometimes in unforeseen ways. And unless theimplementing company makes careful plans for these changes, the effects may beless than optimal. They may even create negative or undesirable effects.Most implementing companies understand, at some level, the business changesthat these process modifications will introduce. While companies may experiencedifficulties in handling the impact of these changes, they are not unforeseen. Usu-ally they are planned and intended to be accomplished during the SAP deploy-ment. But implementing companies are likely to be less clear about the changestheir project team members will experience and the potential effect on the com-pany. Additionally, many implementing companies find themselves unpreparedfor the overall impact of the SAP system itself.This chapter is dedicated to educating the implementing company’s senior exec-utives. It will outline how those changes occur in Section 2.1 and the methods bywhich an implementing company can manage them to its advantage.Figure 2.1 outlines the three types of changes that will impact a company facingan SAP implementation project. These three types of changes can be quite pro-found and generate long-term alterations in company operations. Each changecarries its own set of management challenges.949.book  Seite 29  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness302This chapter will discuss each type of change and its impact on management:왘Introducing major business process modificationsThe project will modify company business processes in at least two ways. Gen-erally, as part of the requirements-setting process in blueprinting, the imple-menting company will choose to adopt key business process changes. Thesewill be known and clearly outlined during design discussions. Many of thesewill make significant changes to existing company operations. These are thechanges that are most commonly identified as process transformations.A second type of business process modification results from the SAP systemitself. Manual processes will now be automated, and process operations thatwere once limited to a regional purview will now have global implications.These often unintended results have far-reaching business consequences forthe implementing company.왘Building new skills in the project teamThe project is a testing ground for company staff. Every SAP implementationproject team, at every type of company, faces major challenges and extremelyrigorous time constraints. While these do lead to fatigue—and, sometimes,burnout—they also create a huge opportunity for growth and developmentamong the team members.Team members who complete the project will have been tested and will haveexpanded their limits as a result of participating in the SAP implementationproject. From the most to the least skilled, each will have greatly enlarged hisor her portfolio of accomplishments. Their values to the company will haveFigure 2.1  Changes Introduced as a Result of an SAP Implementation ProjectHow an SAPimplementationchanges a businessType I:Introduces majorprocess modificationsType II:Builds new skills inthe project teamType III:Transforms SAP into acompany asset949.book  Seite 30  Montag, 7.

It will be up to the implementing company to find roles forthese individuals commensurate with their recent accomplishments.왘Transforming SAP into a company assetOnce the SAP system has deployed, it will change many of the company’s fun-damental operations. Redesigned business processes operating on the SAP sys-tem necessarily produce an integrated company—one where all functionalorganizations clearly depend on the performance of one another. We’ll spellout some of those potential changes using examples in this chapter.Additionally, as with any other major company asset, the system will requirelong-term care and maintenance. SAP is not a plug-and-play system. Rather, itrequires a combination of user skills, system updates, governance, and contin-ual bug fixes to keep it current. Many implementing companies don’t fullygrasp this, and they expect the heavy lifting is complete when the system hasbeen implemented.Let’s begin by examining specific changes that implementations produce.2.1Modifying Major Business ProcessesMany people believe that company-initiated business process modificationsdefine the heart of an SAP transformation project. After all, they think, the list ofactivities that will change and the benefits that these changes will create is oftenthe primary justification for an SAP implementation project.In many ways, they’re right. Unless the implementing company already hasworld-class business processes, the SAP systems project not only allows it to con-sider significant process changes—it encourages that kind of innovative thinking.The project can generate leverage for the company to rethink its ways of doingbusiness. The SAP implementation methodology encourages this broad-basedevaluation. As well, the SAP system can itself provide the foundation for thesemodifications.TipExecutives at the implementing company can provide valuable guidance to the projectteam by identifying needed business process improvement initiatives. The project teamcan use this input as a focus area. This ensures that executives and the project team arein alignment even in these early stages.949.book  Seite 31  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness322Let’s review three types of business process changes: standardization, simplifica-tion, and automation. Each has the advantage of using the system to reducedelays and improve process performance.2.1.1Process StandardizationStandardization of business processes can provide a powerful tool for an imple-menting company. Whenever business processes vary depending on geographi-cal region or between functional organizations, standardization can bringconsistency and positively affect the bottom line.Figure 2.2 illustrates how significant standardization can be. It depicts the imple-menting company’s order-to-cash processes with universally applied standardiza-tion across geographical regions. Prior to the SAP implementation project, theseprocesses would have been performed in varying ways across regional opera-tions. Ranging from customer identification, pricing, and shipping, the exampleshows where the benefits of standardization can be applied.Prior to implementing a global SAP system, it is quite common for companies tooperate in a very diverse fashion at the regional level. However, as the companysupply chain begins to integrate globally, these regional variances will begin tocause problems in both efficiency and effectiveness.Figure 2.2  OTC Standardization as a Process Transformation in an SAP Implementation ProjectCustomersPricingSales ordersCashRebatesExportsDevelop global customer system and numbersAdopt global pricing template for use in all marketsStandardize sales order types among all regionsStandardize global processes for trade promotions, rebates, and chargebacksStandardize global cash and collections processesStandardize export processes and documents in all regionsFocus areaChanges 949.book  Seite 32  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17Modifying Major Business Processes332.1For example, regions may utilize different numbering systems and formats forcustomer identification. In many cases, a single customer might have a differentidentifier in each region. For example, the same global company may have onecustomer number in North America and a slightly different name and totallyunrelated customer number in Asia. The two customer instances will not recon-cile. Simply collecting reliable sales information by customer means that the cor-porate headquarters will have to create and maintain translation tables toconsolidate this data. If you multiply this situation several times by customer,vendor, or pricing, then the problem becomes a very substantial one.Pitfall AlertRegional differences, such as in the customer number example, can be resolved throughthe use of master data. The project team should understand the implications of thesenaming variances and work to address them during data cleansing. Executives can playa key role by making this a priority for the project team.The situation with exports is very similar but often even more diffuse. Exportdocumentation may vary not only by region, but at the country level as well! Thiscreates a need for dedicated staff at the regional and country level whose mainpurpose is to assure that the disparate processes work as intended.The SAP implementation project can create the single best opportunity for a com-pany to break free from the mix of non-standard processes and to remedy theprocess differences. The impetus of the project and the investment involved canlead an implementing company to carefully assess its process imbalances. Includ-ing these process changes in blueprinting will move an implementing companytoward unifying its operations and taking a step toward becoming one globalenterprise.2.1.2Process SimplificationProcess standardization isn’t the only transformation tool available.Even the very best companies contain examples of multi-person documentreviews and approvals. These slow down the normal flow of operations, createunnecessary delays, and for many staff show company culture as behind theprogress curve. An implementing company may also choose to examine overlycomplex processes for the purposes of eliminating non-value-added steps. For949.book  Seite 33  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness342example, an implementing company could have large numbers of non-purchase-order invoices submitted for payment. Each of these is then handled as an excep-tion item that must have managerial review and approval prior to payment,regardless of the amount involved. Handling these invoices through an approvalprocess delays payment and uses company staff in a non-value-added manner.The company could choose to simplify this process as part of the SAP implemen-tation project. By conducting an analysis of the non-purchase-order invoices,their numbers and amounts can be determined. In most cases, the bulk of theseinvoices will have a small dollar value. The company can then shift to simplify thebusiness process. This would include taking steps to reduce the number of non-purchase-order invoices and to require approval for those that represented largerdollar amounts.By identifying those vendors that are approved to submit non-purchase-orderinvoices, the number of invoices can be dramatically reduced. By specifying aminimum dollar value that requires approval, the review process can also be cur-tailed. These process changes can then be configured into the SAP system andbecome standard practice across the company.At one time or another, most companies have experienced large numbers ofunpaid invoices in their accounts-payable backlog. Addressing these issues asexamples of process deficiencies enables a solution to be developed. This solutionresults in better working relationships with suppliers and fewer staff membersdedicated to these non-value-added activities.So process simplification clearly applies in many situations. It will provide themost benefit in routine, large-volume transactions. When bottlenecks and delaysoccur, it’s a sign that a process needs simplifying. The project team, whose mem-bers have considerable experience with the details of company processes, will bewell equipped to generate solutions during the blueprint phase. Receivingencouragement from senior executives to conduct this type of work will serve toincrease focus in these areas.2.1.3Process AutomationAutomating processes is one of the most effective ways to create transformation.Automation uses the SAP system to build reliable and accurate processes. Thedevelopment of custom objects that will be described in later chapters in this949.book  Seite 34  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17Modifying Major Business Processes352.1book enables companies to replace manual steps with those that are entirely auto-mated. An implementing company can make substantial changes to its operationsby building workflows and forms.TipFlag these automation opportunities for the project team. This will have two positiveresults. First, it helps them understand the important areas for transformation. Second,it builds a partnership between executives and the project team. Both will now work onthe same page.Figure 2.3 provides an illustration of the use of manual processing for companyprocurement processes. The steps from purchase order to invoice payment haveall operated in a manual fashion. Purchase orders are created manually and sentto suppliers, who then send printed invoices to the company for products or ser-vices rendered. Once the company gets them, procurement staff and the holder ofthe purchase order physically review these invoices.If any item between the purchase order and the invoice does not reconcile, theprocess is put on hold and the supplier and company must exchange printedmaterial to resolve the differences. Once they resolve any noted discrepancies inthe paperwork, the printed invoice is forwarded for approval at the required levelof management authorization. When this management approval is received, acheck can then be manually issued and sent to the supplier in payment.Take a closer look. The steps in this process are noticeably time-consuming. Theparties spend much time checking for discrepancies and then searching out thereasons for them. Most inconsistencies are due to entry errors made by thesender or receiver rather than attempts at fraudulence. Each company involved,supplier and receiver, pays a penalty in employee time lost for these discrepan-cies. A great deal of this time lost can be restored through automation.Figure 2.3  Manual Procurement ProcessesManualpurchaseorderPrintedinvoicereceiptPhysicalinvoicereviewsPhysicalinvoiceapprovalManualcheckpayment949.book  Seite 35  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness362In the automated version of this process shown in Figure 2.4, all steps are accom-plished in the SAP system and transition points from actor to actor are generatedby workflow technology. Thus, the purchase order can be generated, approved,and distributed to the vendor by means of the SAP Supplier Relationship Manage-ment (SRM) application. Once the services are rendered by the supplier, theresulting invoice is either transmitted electronically or physically scanned by theimplementing company.From that point forward, the invoice is an electronic document that can be imme-diately transferred using workflow to each reviewer or approver in the process.When final approval for invoice payment is received, the disbursement will beaccomplished using electronic funds transfer (EFT) from the payer bank to thesupplier bank. No manual check is required.This and many similar automation processes are available through the SAP systemusing a combination of configuration, portal technology, and workflow. Chapter6 will outline an approach where the implementing company’s senior executivesgive direction to the project team regarding these types of process changes. TheSAP client executive who is servicing the implementing company will be able toset up functionality demonstrations and thereby greatly facilitate use of the SAPsystem in support of process changes.2.2Building New Skills in the Project TeamAn SAP implementation team is a special thing. In most cases, this is a group ofpeople—many without any SAP system knowledge—who are expected to accom-plish a minor miracle. Because this is comparable in scope and effort to the launchof a major software product, the individuals who accomplish a successful SAPimplementation rise to rock star status within the company.Many companies do not recognize the special human asset that they have createdwith the SAP implementation project. Unlike the product launch, many on theFigure 2.4  Automated Procurement Processes in an SAP Implementation ProcessPurchase orderelectronicallyissuedInvoicetransmittedelectronicallyand scannedInvoicetransmitted viaworkflow forreviewInvoiceapproved inworkflowInvoicepayment viaelectronic fundstransfer949.book  Seite 36  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17Building New Skills in the Project Team372.2SAP project team will have limited experience in the core subject matter. Theymay have never used SAP or understood how it works prior to the implementa-tion project. They will generate this subject matter expertise through the lifecycleof the project.Figure 2.5 shows this skill change along four different dimensions: achievingresults, handling responsibility, working under pressure, and demonstratingleadership. When making the shift to the SAP implementation project team, cir-cumstances will alter members’ performance profile. By an almost magical pro-cess, they become a high-performance team. Similar to a fitness regimen, theadded level of effort required can produce substantial gains for those participat-ing. Some team members will make great changes, some will make marginalchanges, and a few will change not at all or even not make the grade. For thosewho do make major changes, the implementing company will acquire humanassets who have greatly exceeded their former capacity.Compared to the effort involved in standard day-to-day tasks, the project teamassignment brings continuous intensity and demand for rapid response to issues.This higher performance requirement creates new levels of capability. The fourdimensions where these changes will take place are as follows:왘Achieving resultsAn SAP implementation project is a series of ongoing demands for results. Ona daily basis, the project team members are expected to produce according toFigure 2.5  Team Member Skills Development Profile in an SAP Implementation ProjectAchievingresultsHandlingresponsibilityWorking underpressureDemonstratingleadershipHighMediumLowNormal workrequirementsSAP projectrequirements949.book  Seite 37  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness382the schedule and deliverables required. Every team member has an assignmentand is expected to accomplish it. Achieving results is built into the DNA of anSAP project team and soon becomes a part of the DNA for every project teammember.The will to succeed and to resolve obstacles becomes a point of pride for virtu-ally all team members. Each obstacle overcome becomes a matter of pride andreminds the team just how proficient it is. Teams create their own culture andthis can manifest itself in many ways. However, at the core of an effective SAPproject team is a shared drive to achieve results.왘Handling responsibilityTeams and team members fundamentally understand that they own theirdeliverables. The responsibility for success or failure lies with each individual.Over time, teams become adept at identifying their responsibilities and makingsure they are accomplished. No one is looking over their shoulders and no oneneeds to. Nor does anyone spend time reminding team members of their dead-lines. They already know them.왘Working under pressureImplementing companies are especially familiar with the old adage that “timeis money.” Any delays to the project plan will undoubtedly cost the companyand create unforeseen expenses. These, in turn, can necessitate a reallocationof financial budgets. Of course, these are not popular. Overruns may impactthe company revenue stream by placing holds on product launches or hiring ofnew sales representatives.Because everyone on the project team remains acutely aware of the costsattached to delays, they strive to do everything possible to stay on time. Almostalways, this involves the team working longer hours and finding creative solu-tions to make deadlines. Working under this kind of pressure for two to threeyears leaves a lasting impression on team members’ work habits. What waspreviously a difficult and stressful challenge now becomes a normal part ofdaily business.왘Demonstrating leadershipEveryone on an SAP project team becomes a leader at one time or another;more often than not, this occurs without the accompanying title. With so manythings to be done and so little time to do them, team members quite commonlytake on leadership roles when they see that initiative is required.949.book  Seite 38  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17Transforming SAP into a Company Asset392.3This is especially true during realization and final preparation when, comparedto blueprinting, the number of deliverables per week can triple or quadruple.Team members recognize what tasks require leadership and then provide it. Itis very common during systems testing to see team members take a leadershiprole on their own initiative for cross-workstream testing or managing defectresolution.The message is clear: Companies that appoint an SAP implementation projectteam receive a secondary bonus. They greatly expand the capabilities of their staffassigned to the project team. The challenge is to provide job responsibilities andtasks after the project has been completed commensurate with these increasedskill levels.This requires planning on the part of project sponsors and constant assessment ofeach project team member. In this way, the implementing company is in positionto take advantage of the high-performance team it has created.2.3Transforming SAP into a Company AssetMichael Doane, author of The SAP Blue Book and The SAP Green Book (SAP PRESS,2012), has urged implementing companies to see the SAP system as a long-terminvestment and treat it as such. Let’s elaborate on this theme and connect it to theSAP implementation project.Doane makes the case that a great many implementing companies focus almostexclusively on getting the SAP implementation project right and fail to recognizethat, as a long-term asset, an SAP system will require considerable upkeep andmaintenance during its likely 20-year period of use.Doane’s asset-based approach is important for two reasons.1.It encourages companies to see the SAP implementation project as setting thestage for long-term system usage. Rather than completely emphasizing the suc-cess of the short-term implementation project, the company would also focuson how to make the system viable for company operations over time.2.It provides a wake-up call to the company. Putting an SAP system in place iscomparable to using company and system integrator resources to build a vehi-cle. Except this vehicle will exhibit properties of a mass-transit system, with949.book  Seite 39  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness402all its complexities. It will have large numbers of users located in differentgeographical locations. It will also require continual maintenance to stay inworking order.The argument goes something like this: Those elements that make for a successfulproject do not necessarily make for a successful long-term company asset. Forreasons of cost, pride, and urgency, the implementation project centers on speedto deployment. This focus may cause the company to set aside those factors thatwould make for successful long-term use of the SAP system, including in-depthconsideration of needed business processes or building user skills necessary tooperate the system.Pitfall AlertIf the implementing company already has an SAP sustainment organization, addresshow it will work together with the project team throughout the life cycle. Make surethat everyone is on board. If the implementing company does not have an SAP sustain-ment organization, begin the planning right now.Figure 2.6 shows these two components: SAP system implementation and SAPsystem long-term usage. The implementation project has large numbers ofresources devoted to it, is assigned a very substantial budget of companyresources, and develops its own sense of importance. On the other hand, for mostcompanies, preparing for continuous operations remains very much a back-burner activity; they wait until after the implementation has been completed toplan post-go-live operations.Figure 2.6  Relative Timing for SAP System Implementation versus SAP System OperationSAP implementationprojectSAP continuous operationsGo-live949.book  Seite 40  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17Transforming SAP into a Company Asset412.3Let’s consider the relative timing of implementation and ongoing operations. Animplementation may take three years, and long-term system operation may go onfor at least five times that long. All of a sudden, it’s apparent that the investmentto put the system in place dwarfs the investment to keep it running.Further, the kinds of investments to put the system in place differ markedly fromthose required to keep the system in place. As Table 2.1 indicates, the types ofactivities needed to deliver the system will likely vary considerably from thoseneeded to maintain the system once it is live. By definition, the SAP project teamis a delivery-focused organization. This means in practice that project leadershipconcerns itself solely with putting the system in place and relegates all other mat-ters to second place. On the other hand, once go-live has occurred, the SAP sus-tainment organization pays utmost attention to how the system is operating andhow to improve that experience.System-Related ActivitiesSystem DeliverySystem Operation and MaintenanceEssential activities왘In-depth understanding of business process changes왘Ability to create company commitment to delivering the system왘Proficiency in documenting system design decisions왘Capability to write test scripts and conduct thorough testing왘Ability to conduct data-conversion processes from legacy systems왘High degree of system user skills왘Committed super users and pro-cess owners active in system usage왘Effective system governance at all levels in the company that decides questions of system continuity왘Skilled SAP-focused IT business analysts who support the system왘Rapid and coordinated responses to system outagesImportant activities왘Skills in developing targeted user-training materials왘Focus on timelines and deliv-erables왘Designing plans for system releases왘Monitoring system performanceTable 2.1  Activities Needed for System Delivery versus System Maintenance949.book  Seite 41  Montag, 7. Juli 2014  5:38 17How an SAP Implementation ChangesBusiness422The information presented in Table 2.1 makes an important distinction: The skillscritical for system delivery will not be the same ones critical for system sustain-ment. Thus a company SAP governance team that has led a successful implemen-tation will not necessarily be prepared for governing the now-live system for theyears ahead. An implementing company making effective plans for system gover-nance must make sure this transition point is well understood and needed skillsets are in place.Our final chapter, Chapter 23, reviews the transition process to sustainment andhow the governance process will operate in this new world. Sustainment will lackthe drama and constant urgency of the implementation project. However, it willbe equally important for the company to perform well. Building the home well isone thing; learning how to live in it is very much another.But before arriving at sustainment, we have a good distance yet to travel and agreat deal of material to cover. Our next chapter describes the Accelerated SAPmethodology. It gives an overall roadmap for the project team to travel in itsimplementation journey. Let’s head there now!949.book  Seite 42  Montag, 7.

Gerald Sullivan has a 25-year background in implemen-
tations. He has operated from the systems integrator side,

large-scale SAP projects for implementing companies. 
Industries involved include life sciences, consumer-pack- 
aged goods, electronics, and financial services. His past 
experience as a professor in graduate schools of manage-

ment and as a quality improvement executive contribute to a unique per-
spective and broad contextual knowledge of the challenges of implementa-
tion. He has a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. Dr. 
Sullivan is the president of SAP Global Consultants, a consultancy offering 
project management advisory services to implementing companies. He can
