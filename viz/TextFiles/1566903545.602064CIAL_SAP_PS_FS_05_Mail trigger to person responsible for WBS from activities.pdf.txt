1. OBJECTIVE 
 

The  functional  specification  allows  the  developer  to  understand  the  development 
requirements  from  a  functional  point  of  view  and  provides  all  necessary  functional 
details to enable the programmer to develop the technical solution.  

The  content  and  level  of  detail  of  the  following  sections  strongly  depends  on  the  type 
and complexity of the technical solution to be developed.  

 

•  Workflow 

 

Workflow  mail  to  trigger  to  the  person  responsible  for  WBS  element  on  the  following 
changes to the activity: 

1.  If the activity is marked “High Priority” 

2.  If the activity actual start is not as per scheduled start date. 

3.  If activity actual finish date is not as per activities scheduled finish date. 

4.  If activity is not started.

4. WORKFLOW 

Note:  This section should be filled out for each relevant component. 

This section may be marked N/A if it is not relevant. 

This section specifies the business requirements on the workflow.   

4.1  Process/Data Flow Diagram 

Place a VISIO cross-functional flow diagram depicting the process flow of the workflow.  The diagram 
need not describe every detail, but should show any automated/manual processes and agents involved in 
the workflow, and provide a Functional Level understanding of the data that needs to flow between the 
processes.

B Naming Conventions 

 

Document Naming Convention: CIAL_DT_<Module Name>_<Description>.doc 

 

Module Name – Functional Work stream. Example, For FICO Functional specification, <Module Name> 
should be FI. 

• 

FI = Finance 

•  MM = Procurement 

•  PP = Manufacturing 

• 

SD = Sales & Distribution 

•  HR = Human Resource 

•  PM = Maintenance 

•  PS = Project System 

•  WM = Warehouse Management 

•  DMS = Document Management System 

• 

EHS = Environment Health & Safety 

DT- Document Type indicator, in this case it is FS (Functional Specification).
