Purpose 

 Project  is  in  Support  and  Maintenance 
phase  which  includes  test  design  and 
testing of CR and Production Incidents. 

 Every month new CR /Incidents/ Issues/ 
Defects are logged. Some of the CRs are 
either enhancements of the earlier CR or 
related  to  particular  old  CR  and  others 
having new requirement. 

 The  team  has  to  prepare  test  data 
according  to  the  requirements  of  the 
CRs/Incidents for System Testing. 

 The  purpose  behind  the  re-usability  of 
the  existing  test  data  is  to  reduce  the 
time spent in preparing the new test data 
manually every time. 

 By using the test data created for the old
